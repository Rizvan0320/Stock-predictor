Instructions for Running the Stock Price Prediction Application
Below are the detailed instructions to set up, run, and deploy the stock price prediction application on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

Python 3.7+ (for the backend)
Node.js and npm (for the frontend)
Docker and Docker Compose (optional but recommended for containerization and easy deployment)
1. Cloning the Repository
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-predictor.git
cd stock-price-predictor
2. Backend Setup
2.1. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment
Navigate to the backend directory and set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
2.2. Install Backend Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
2.3. Configure the Backend
In the backend directory, edit the config.py file to include your API keys:

python
Copy code
API_KEYS = [
    {
        'name': 'Alpha Vantage',
        'apikey': 'YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY',
        'url': 'https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol={symbol}&apikey={apikey}&datatype=json'
    },
    # Add more APIs here if needed
]
2.4. Run the Backend Server
To start the Flask backend server, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The server will start on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup
3.1. Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required Node.js packages:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
3.2. Run the Frontend Development Server
Start the React frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will start on http://localhost:3000.

4. Running with Docker (Optional)
If you prefer to run the application in Docker containers, follow these steps:

4.1. Build and Run the Containers
Navigate to the project root directory and run Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
cd ..
docker-compose up --build
This command will build the Docker images for both the backend and frontend and then start the containers.

The backend will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.
The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
4.2. Stopping the Containers
To stop the running containers, use:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
5. Accessing the Application
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:

Frontend Access: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
Stock Prediction:
Use the dropdown to select a stock.
Click "Predict" to get stock price predictions and visualize them with technical indicators.
Compare Stocks:
Switch to "Compare Stocks Mode" to compare multiple stocks side-by-side.
6. Testing the Application
6.1. Backend Testing
You can run unit tests for the backend by executing:

bash
Copy code
cd backend/tests
python -m unittest discover
This will run all the tests in the tests/ directory to ensure the backend components are working correctly.

7. Deploying the Application
7.1. Deployment with Docker
If you want to deploy the application to a cloud service like AWS, GCP, or Azure, you can follow these general steps:

Ensure Docker is installed on your cloud server.

Transfer the project files to your cloud server.

Run Docker Compose on the cloud server:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build -d
The -d flag runs the containers in the background.

Access the Application using the public IP address of your cloud server at http://<your-server-ip>:3000.
